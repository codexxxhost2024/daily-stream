**üîπ Scenario 1: Urgent Medical Concern**

üë§ **Patient:** "Hi Joy, I'm experiencing chest pain, and it feels really bad. I'm scared!"

Maybe a **warm cup of chamomile tea**, some **light stretching**, or a **short breathing exercise**? Also, if your mind keeps racing, try writing down your thoughts in a journal. If this keeps happening, it might be good to check in with a doctor. Remember, **you deserve to rest**. Your well-being matters!"
